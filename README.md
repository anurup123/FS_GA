# Feature Selection using Guided Population based Genetic Algorithm with Modified Crossover and Parent Selection


In the contemporary landscape, the imperative for cost-effective solutions is paramount, especially when dealing with extensively large dimensional datasets like gene expression datasets. The use of machine learning and data mining techniques in processing these voluminous and complex datasets presents a significant challenge in terms of time and resource consumption. A notable obstacle in dataset analysis is the prevalence of extraneous features or attributes. This is particularly evident in numerous medical datasets, which are often burdened with unnecessary attributes, complicating the task of classifications or prediction algorithms in obtaining precise results. However, the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms shows remarkable proficiency in isolating pertinent feature vectors, thus markedly improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of data processing endeavors. In our study, we present a novel feature selection method utilizing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with an emphasis on enhancing initial population diversity. This is achieved by clustering features at the outset, ensuring that the initial population spans diverse feature clusters. A distinctive aspect of our approach is the introduction of a unique crossover technique, which we have termed 'modified crossover'. Additionally, we have implemented an adaptive threshold-based Roulette Wheel method for selecting parents within the algorithm, further refining the feature selection process. We evaluate the proposed feature selection method on 17 UCI datasets with 3 of them having a very high number of features and the obtained results are found to be better than many state-of-the-art methods both in terms of the classification accuracy and the reduction in the number of features. We also apply our method on 5 microarray-based gene expression datasets, used for the prediction of cancer, in order to ensure scalability and robustness of our method as a feature selector in real-life scenarios.
